SUBJECT: Following Up — ALL TRUTH Series Evaluation for [Library Name]

Dear [Librarian Name],

I wanted to follow up on the evaluation copy of ALL TRUTH Volume 1 that I sent over last week.

I hope you've had a chance to review the material. I'd welcome your initial thoughts on:

• Whether the content aligns with your library's professional development focus
• Potential interest from your patron base
• Fit within your collection development strategy

I know acquisitions reviews take time, so if you need additional time to evaluate the material, that's no problem at all. I'm here to answer any questions that come up during your review process.

QUESTIONS I CAN ADDRESS:
• Content scope and depth (what the remaining volumes cover)
• Institutional licensing structures
• Digital access and distribution options  
• Pricing for different library types
• Use case examples from other professional development contexts

NEXT STEPS:
If you're still evaluating, no response needed—take the time you need.

If you're ready to discuss next steps, I'm available for a brief call at your convenience. You can reach me at:

Or, if you've determined that this series isn't the right fit for your collection at this time, I'd still appreciate any feedback you're willing to share. It helps me understand how to better serve libraries in the future.

Thank you again for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Kevin Lewis
ASAP Enterprises
